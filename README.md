## 🎯 About This Project

This repository has a dual purpose:

1.  **📚 Primary Goal: A Public Knowledge Base:** To create a structured, easy-to-navigate set of notes to prepare for the LFCS certification. The content is inspired by excellent resources like [Giuliano Polverari's LFCS guide](https://giulianopz.github.io/lfcs/).

2.  **🚀 Secondary Goal: A Tech Demo:** To explore and showcase the power and simplicity of the **native Jekyll deployment method on GitHub Pages**. This project intentionally avoids complex CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) to demonstrate how quickly a professional-looking documentation site can be launched with minimal configuration.

## ✨ Tech Stack

This site is built with a beautifully simple and powerful stack:

*   🌐 **GitHub Pages:** For free, fast, and reliable static site hosting.
*   📄 **Jekyll (Native Engine):** The site is built by GitHub's internal, "zero-config" Jekyll engine. No local installation or build scripts needed.
*   🎨 **Just the Docs Theme:** A modern, highly-configurable Jekyll theme for documentation, loaded effortlessly via the `remote_theme` feature.
*   ✍️ **Markdown:** All content is written in plain Markdown, making it easy to edit and contribute.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply navigate the topics using the sidebar on the [live site](https://dozamo.github.io/lfcs/). The structure is designed to be intuitive, following the official LFCS domains.
