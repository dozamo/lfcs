## My Personal LFCS Study Guide

Welcome! This site serves as my personal, evolving knowledge base for the **[Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin (LFCS)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/#exams)** certification. It's a collection of notes, commands, and key concepts organized to aid in my studies and, hopefully, to help others on a similar path.

The content is a work in progress, compiled from various resources and my own hands-on practice.

### 🚀 Exam Domains Structure

To align directly with the certification requirements, this guide is structured to mirror the official **LFCS Domains & Competencies** as published by The Linux Foundation. You can use the sidebar to navigate through each core area.

The main domains covered are:

* **Operations Deployment** (25%)
* **Networking** (25%)
* **Storage** (20%)
* **Essential Commands** (20%)
* **Users and Groups** (10%)

Each section will contain detailed notes, practical examples, and configuration snippets relevant to that domain.

### 📚 Additional Resources & Notes

Beyond the official domains, this site also includes supplementary sections that I find useful:

* **LFS201 Course Notes:** Personal notes and key takeaways from the Linux Foundation's "Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201)" course. This section consolidates crucial concepts from the training material.

* **Meta: Site Deployment:** A special section detailing how this site itself is built and deployed. It serves as a practical example of using **GitHub Pages with its native Jekyll engine** and the `just-the-docs` theme, requiring zero CI/CD pipeline configuration. A great real-world use case!
